Chilling statistics prove drunken driving is a major cause of accidents. India has the highest number of road accidents in the world killing 1,34,000 people every year. Of this 70% or over 93,800 cases are due to consumption of alcohol.

Drunken driving: How much is too much?

Across cities in India, police have been setting up check points to curb the menace of drunken driving and prosecuting offenders. Fines and jail terms still aren’t enough and accidents continue to rise. India in fact has among the lowest limits for alcohol levels in blood, but still our road accidents and alcohol-related cases are higher than most parts of the developed world.

What does the law say?
Police measure blood alcohol content (BAC) by using a breathalyzer. The legal limit of alcohol content in blood is 0.03% or 30mg per 100ml of blood. If a person driving a car has a BAC level of 30mg per 100 ml of blood, he or she can be booked under section 185 of the Motor Vehicle Act, which consists of imprisonment of up to six months or fine of up to Rs. 2,000 or both. For a subsequent offence within three years, the prison term can extend up to 2 years with a fine of Rs. 3,000 or both.

One’s reflexes while driving a motor vehicle can be impaired with a blood alcohol content of anything above zero. Even things like cough syrups and certain health tonics such as Waterbury’s compound contain alcohol, which can be detected in the blood stream, but in small quantities. This is why most manufacturers of such tonics and cough syrups also print stern warnings on the labels about not driving or operating machinery after consuming these medicines.

Statistic show that people with even a small percentage of alcohol in their bloodstream are 2.5 times more likely to be involved in an accident than those who don’t have alcohol. So just how much alcohol does it take to cross the legal limit?

How much is too much?

Ideally, any alcohol is too much. However, since the law stipulates a maximum limit of 30 mg per 100 ml of blood, one would think it is perfectly legal to have a couple of drinks and then drive home. But think again. This limit can very easily be crossed before you know it.

Alcohol absorption in the blood stream is affected by two things – the body mass of the person and the amount of hydration or water content in the body. Those of you who do enjoy your drinks, would have noticed that some days it takes a few more drinks than other days to get tipsy and sometimes it takes very little.</p>
